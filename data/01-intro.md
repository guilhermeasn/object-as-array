# Getting Started

Manipulate a javascript object with some of the most used functions in arrays.

## Installation

Add the **object-as-array** package to your project with *npm*:

```
npm install object-as-array
```

Or with *yarn*:

```
yarn add object-as-array
```

## Forms of use

You can use the functions in this package with functional or modular programming.
In functional programming, methods are derived from the objectAsArray function, see its typing below:

```<O extends object>(object: O): ObjectAsArray<O>```

Note, the keys of ObjectInfo and ObjectData types are:

```key | value | entrie```
